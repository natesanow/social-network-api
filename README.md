# Social Network API

## Description

In this challenge i was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

I built this code using the mini project folder structure and in collabaration with a local tutor i have worked with. I have only gotten the API server running on port but that is as far as i could get it working.
